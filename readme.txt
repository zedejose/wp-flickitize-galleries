Turn your native WordPress galleries into beautiful fully responsive carousel sliders. Adjust the carousel to your needs on a per gallery base.

== Description ==
WP Flickitize Galleries turns your native WordPress galleries into beautiful fully responsive sliders, using the [Flickity JS library](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/).

This initial release does not support options yet.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the extracted plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly
2. Activate the plugin through the “Plugins” screen in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I don’t want all galleries to become sliders! Is this possible? =
On each gallery edit modal there’s a checkbox called “Use Flickity”. If you leave this box unchecked your gallery will be a normal, WordPress-native gallery.

= Is it possible to place the slider somewhere else, say in a widget? =
Since the plugin uses the default gallery shortcode, you can simply paste it wherever you want it to appear.
Note that you may need to [enable support for shortcodes in widgets](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-use-shortcodes-in-your-wordpress-sidebar-widgets/).

== License ==
This plugin is distributed using the GPLv2 license, but Flickity uses a hybrid license. If the site you use this in is a commercial site, you need to comply with their [commercial license](https://flickity.metafizzy.co/license.html).
